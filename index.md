## Good morning

This is a test. 

Well now how about that.

Breach investigations are problematic in todayâ€™s logging architectures because data is often only kept online for 90 days or less. 

Persisting data in expensive block storage, replicated many times, and with large full text indexes makes long retention times cost prohibitive. Storing compressed raw log data, with no index, especially with the cost effectiveness of infrequent access object storage, can cost-effectively store 100x the amount of data for the same price. 

Queryable observability lakes give investigators access to unparalleled retention to be able to rewind the clock the six months or a year required to look back to when breaches occurred before being detected.
